# cakephp-datatables

[DataTables](https://www.datatables.net) is a jQuery plugin for intelligent HTML tables. Next to adding dynamic elements to the table, it also has great supports for on-demand data fetching and server-side processing. The _cakephp-datatables_ plugin makes it easy to use the functionality DataTables provides in your CakePHP 3 application. It consists of a helper to add DataTables to your view and a Component to transparently process AJAX requests made by DataTables.

This is the php5 branch to support webservers with outdated software.
